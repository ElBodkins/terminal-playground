# Terminal Playground

**Learn Linux and Docker commands through a browser-based interactive environment—no local setup required.**

## 🚀 The Problem This Solves

Learning command-line tools presents a steep barrier for beginners:

- ⚠️ Complex local environment setup
- ⚠️ Risk of system misconfiguration
- ⚠️ Lack of structured learning paths
- ⚠️ No safe space for experimentation

This project eliminates those friction points by providing:  
✔️ Realistic terminal emulation in the browser  
✔️ Pre-configured Linux/Docker environments  
✔️ Guided lessons with immediate feedback  
✔️ Zero-risk experimentation sandbox

## ✨ Key Features

- **📟 Interactive Terminals**  
  Fully functional Linux shell and Docker CLI simulator

- **📚 Progressive Learning**  
  Curriculum from `ls` to `docker compose`

- **🆘 Contextual Help**  
  Built-in command explanations and examples

- **🛡️ Safe Environment**  
  Execute `rm -rf` without fear
